# Laptop provisions

Script to setup the tools I want to have available on a new Mac

It will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first and then use that to install various tools

See this [homebrew](https://devhints.io/homebrew) cheatsheet for useful commands

## Usage

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubenWerdmuller/laptop-provisions/main/provisions.sh)"
```
